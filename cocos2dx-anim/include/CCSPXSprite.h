 * @class CCSPXSprite

 * \par
 * SpriteX is a tool of animation, exported file has *.sprite name. The structure of sprite
 * file is similar with anu file but different terms used.
 *
 * \par
 * This class supports exported file of SpriteX 3.9.4. For SpriteX 2011, you need \link CCSPX3Sprite CCSPX3Sprite\endlink
 * because file format is totally changed. Remember SpriteX 3.9.4 is second generation not third, that's why SpriteX 2011 uses
 * SPX3 prefix. Maybe a little confusing so be careful.
